How testing works:

/home/duybao/SoSe21/AVISPA_May21/TestCase/train_test.sh
------------------------------------------------
What it does:
First training the model by using the train.py, then testing by using process.py
----------------------
How it works:

A lot of functions in train.py comes from util.py (example: "util.set_img_format()")

Here all models-datasets combination are tested

During testing phase:
- The weight from the trained model (model_name.h5) from the AVISPA/TestCase/classify/trained are loaded. (Trough the "get_model_from_model_name()" of util.py. The foldername of the saved and trained model is the classification_model_name (example: classification_model_name=xception_RNGN19co)

The results are written in the txt file of AVISPA_May21/TestCase/out/ folder
Here example of the code: 
(train output)...|tee /home/duybao/SoSe21/AVISPA_May21/TestCase/out/out_vgg16_RNGN19co_train.txt
(train output) ...|tee /home/duybao/SoSe21/AVISPA_May21/TestCase/out/out_vgg16_RNGN19co_pred.txt
